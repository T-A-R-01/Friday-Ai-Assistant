Here is a sample table in Excel to record student marks:

**Student Marks Table**

| **Student Name** | **Roll No.** | **Maths** | **Science** | **English** | **History** | **Total** | **Percentage** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| John Smith | 1 | 85 | 90 | 78 | 92 | 345 | 86.25 |
| Jane Doe | 2 | 92 | 85 | 95 | 88 | 360 | 90.00 |
| Bob Johnson | 3 | 78 | 80 | 82 | 85 | 325 | 81.25 |
| Maria Rodriguez | 4 | 95 | 98 | 90 | 95 | 378 | 94.50 |
| David Lee | 5 | 88 | 92 | 85 | 90 | 355 | 88.75 |

**Formulas used:**

* Total: `=SUM(B2:E2)` (assuming the marks are in columns B to E)
* Percentage: `=TOTAL/F5*100` (assuming the total marks are in cell F5)

You can customize this table to fit your specific needs, such as adding more columns for additional subjects or modifying the formulas to calculate the percentage differently.
